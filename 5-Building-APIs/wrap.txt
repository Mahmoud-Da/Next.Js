*** 2-Getting a Collection of Objects ***
- how to create api
first inside the app folder we create api folder

PS: the api folder is not required but is convention to follow 

- inside the api folder we can have a collection of folder of each endpoint ex: (users, posts, and so on)

what is the endpoint
**************************
- definition:
Endpoints are physical devices that connect to and exchange information with a computer network. Some examples of endpoints are mobile devices, desktop computers, virtual machines, embedded devices, and servers.
In other word endpoint is a remote computing device that communicates back and forth with a network to which it is connected. Examples of endpoints include:

Desktops
Laptops
Smartphones
Tablets
Servers
Workstations
Internet-of-things (IoT) devices
Endpoints represent key vulnerable points of entry for cybercriminals. Endpoints are where attackers execute code and exploit vulnerabilities, 
as well as where there are assets to be encrypted, exfiltrated or leveraged. 
With organizational workforces becoming more mobile and users connecting to internal resources from off-premises endpoints all over the world, 
endpoints are increasingly susceptible to cyberattacks. Objectives for targeting endpoints include, but are not limited to:

Use an endpoint as an entry and exit point to access high-value assets and information on an organizationâ€™s network.
Access assets on the endpoint to exfiltrate or hold hostage, either for ransom or purely for disruption.
Take control of the device and use it in a botnet to execute a DoS attack.

simple way:
endpoint is like a destination point or a specific place where two or more things meet or communicate. 
In the context of technology, it often refers to a device or a node in a network where data is sent or received.
For example, your smartphone, computer, or any device connected to the internet can be considered an endpoint. 
When you send an email or browse a website, data is exchanged between your device and a server, 
and both your device and the server are endpoints in that communication.
**************************

- inside the api/users we create route.tsx 

very important
**************************
in a folder we can have page.tsx or route.tsx not both 
page.tsx: we use it when we want to show to the user  markup or HTML element content
route.tsx: we use it if we want to handle HTTP Request 
**************************

- inside the api/users/route.tsx we create one or more Route Handler
Route Handler: is a function that handle an HTTP request 
HTTP request have multi methods
GET => getting data
POST =>  creating data
PUT => updateing data

- inside the route.tsx we will use handle GET HTTP request 
export function GET(request: NextRequest){
  // fetch data form DB
};

in this function we receive a HTTP request and return a response 
PS: in real world application we fetch data from the DB

- inside the GET Route handler we return NextResponse and we call json method and inside 
the json method we can return any kind of object or even simple string for ex:
- returning simple string
export function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.json("hello");
}

now if we access to api/users we can see the hello world 

- returning simple object

export function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return NextResponse.json([
    { id: 1, name: "Moody" },
    { id: 2, name: "Lili" },
  ]);
}


now if we access to api/users we can see our endpoint

PS: we didn`t use requst parameter but we add it coz without it next js well cache the result of our response

*** 3-Getting a single of Objects ***
Getting a single of Objects means for ex: getting user 1 from the url
ex: api/users/1

to do that
- we create [id] folder inside the users folder and inside it we create new route.tsx file
the same technique in the previos lesson we create Props of params

now inside the Get router handlerwe should write code to 
1- Fetch the data from a DB
2- if found , return the data
3- If not found, return 404 error
