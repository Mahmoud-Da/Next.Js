*** 2-What is Next.Js ***
- What is Next.Js:
a framework for building fast & search-engine friendly applications
is built in top of React 

=> so everything we have learnt a bout React is still relevant But
Next.Js takes web development to the next level
While React is just a library for creating interactive (UIs)
Next.Js is comprehensive framework 

a framework = libs + tools + conventions that streamline application development

Next.Js is including it`s own routing library so we don`t need to use a separate library ex: when React we used react-routes

- Next.Js come with:
1- Compiler:
Transform & minify JS code

2- CLI:
Build & Start apps 

3- Node.js Runtime:
Excute JS Code

- What is a Node.Js runtime?
before 2009 JavaScript only was excuteble inside the server until 
Ryan Dahl create Node to make JavaScript runs outside the Browser

there is two ways that we can excute JavaScript
web Browser => client side
Node.js => Server side

Node.js is a fancy term for a program that can excute JavaScript code 

- Next.Js comes with a Node.js runtime and this allows us to do really cool things 
1- we can do Full-stack development
so we can write both the front-end and the back-end within the same Next.Js project
Back-end code runs with Node.Js
Front-end code runs with Web Browser
so the code we wrote in the Back-end it sent to the client for excution within a web browser

=> in contrast when building application with React we have to maintain a separate Back-end project 
in a potentially different programming language

2- allows us to render our component on the server
and sent it content to the client
This Technique is called "Server-Side Rendering(SSR) "
and it makes our application
- faster
- more search-engine friendly

- with Next.Js we can rerender certain pages and component that have 
static data when we build our application
we just render them once and serve them whenever they are needed 
This Technique is called "Static-Site Generation"
and can make our application super fast

*** Project Structure ***
folders:
- app => called the app-folder or app-router this file is the container
of our routing system

inisde the app-folder:
we have
- global-css: for global styling
- layout.tsx: basic react component that returns an html and body elements
this represent the common layout for our pages
inside the body element we childer
<body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
which is replaced by a page dynamically at the runtime depending on where the user is in our application
