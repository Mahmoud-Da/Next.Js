*** 2-What is Next.Js ***
- What is Next.Js:
a framework for building fast & search-engine friendly applications
is built in top of React 

=> so everything we have learnt a bout React is still relevant But
Next.Js takes web development to the next level
While React is just a library for creating interactive (UIs)
Next.Js is comprehensive framework 

a framework = libs + tools + conventions that streamline application development

Next.Js is including it`s own routing library so we don`t need to use a separate library ex: when React we used react-routes

- Next.Js come with:
1- Compiler:
Transform & minify JS code

2- CLI:
Build & Start apps 

3- Node.js Runtime:
Excute JS Code

- What is a Node.Js runtime?
before 2009 JavaScript only was excuteble inside the server until 
Ryan Dahl create Node to make JavaScript runs outside the Browser

there is two ways that we can excute JavaScript
web Browser => client side
Node.js => Server side

Node.js is a fancy term for a program that can excute JavaScript code 

- Next.Js comes with a Node.js runtime and this allows us to do really cool things 
1- we can do Full-stack development
so we can write both the front-end and the back-end within the same Next.Js project
Back-end code runs with Node.Js
Front-end code runs with Web Browser
so the code we wrote in the Back-end it sent to the client for excution within a web browser

=> in contrast when building application with React we have to maintain a separate Back-end project 
in a potentially different programming language

2- allows us to render our component on the server
and sent it content to the client
This Technique is called "Server-Side Rendering(SSR) "
and it makes our application
- faster
- more search-engine friendly

- with Next.Js we can rerender certain pages and component that have 
static data when we build our application
we just render them once and serve them whenever they are needed 
This Technique is called "Static-Site Generation"
and can make our application super fast

*** 5-Project Structure ***
folders:
-- app => called the app-folder or app-router this file is the container
of our routing system

inisde the app-folder:
we have
- global-css: for global styling

- layout.tsx: basic react component that returns an html and body elements
this represent the common layout for our pages
inside the body element we childer
<body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
which is replaced by a page dynamically at the runtime depending on where the user is in our application

- page.tsx: represent our home-page 
for this demo we will remove everything inside the return statment and we will return

return <main>Hello World</main>;

in our browser we can see the Hello world with fast refresh
so anytime we make any changes to our typescript or css files, the changes are reflected immediately

now we can see our main page in browser have a style that coz the styles which applied
to the body element inside the globals.css file

to remove the linear background we remove the 

background: linear-gradient(
      to bottom,
      transparent,
      rgb(var(--background-end-rgb))
    )
    rgb(var(--background-start-rgb));

from the body element in globals.css

(coz my chrome is black the defualt font-color is white so i changed the color)
from 
color: rgb(var(--foreground-rgb));
to 
color: black

finaly we apply padding 1 rem to the body so our text is not too close to the edge
padding: 1rem;


-- public folder
this where we can put our public assests, like images

and other configurations files for the most part we don`t have to touch them 
if in the future we needed to change any one of it we will revisit them

*** 6-Routing-and-Navigatio ***

- Routing:
- the Routing in Next.js is based on the file system
in the app folder we create new folder users
to make the users folder publicly accessible, we should add inside it page.tsx/page.jsx file
Ps: make to sure to name it page in lower case coz the conventions that the Next.Js looks for
so the route file system in Next.Js is based on convention not configuration

- inside the page.tsx
in this file we should export a react component that will be rerendered when the user is at this location "/users"

now we generating component using rafce after creating the the component we should the function with capital letters
in this case 
instead of 
const page ==> const UserPage

in our browser we go to 
http://localhost:3000/users
we will see the new component

- another thing a bout the routing system in Next.Js
in the users folder we added another file baside the page.tsx it will not be accessible
ex:
http://localhost:3000/users/test.css
we will have this page can`t be found

- we can create a nasted routes
for example inside the users folder we can add new folder and again inside the new folder we create page.tsx
now if we access to 
http://localhost:3000/users/new
we will see 
NewUserPage (the page.tsx component inside the users/new folder)

- Navigation:
in the page.tsx of app folder 
if we want to navigate we don`t user a(hayper text)
<a href="/users">Users</a>
the reason why coz everytime we click on that Users all the style sheets are redownloaded
which make our application performance slow when it became bigger
for example we clike on Users we don`t want to rerender the same parts (NavBar, Side-Menu, UserCompnent) only we 
want to render the Users component
(we can check that using the Network tab and see all the resourses are redownloaded even if clear them when click the Users hypertext)

this where we use the link Component  
<Link href="/users">Users</Link>
and we can see only the UserCompnent requests and only in resourses we see the content 
of the add/new/page.tsx content that what we called Client Side Navigation

*** 7-Client-and-Server-Components ***
in the Next.Js project we have two enviromnets where we can render our components
and generate HTML markup, either on the client within a web browser

- Rendering components on the client it similar to how the React application work
we refer to this Technique as client-side rendering (CSR)

- Rendering component on the server called server-side rendering (SSR) where the component
is rendered on the server 

What are Diffrenses:
- client-side rendering:
1- Large bundle:
as our application grows, so does our bundle size coz it must contain
all of our components.
the larger the bundle the more memory we need on the client to load all these component
so client-side rendering is resourses heavy

2- Resource intensive:
coz the Large bundle problem

3- No SEO (search engine bots):
the search engine bots which are machines that browser and index our websites, can`t view
our contact coz because they can`t excute JavaScript code, so they can`t render our component
like we browser

4- less secure:
any sensitive data we have in our component or their dependencies like API keys, will ve exposed to the client

- server-side rendering:
1- small bundle:
coz we only send the essintial components to the client and prevent our bundle from becoming
unnecessarily large

2- Resource efficient:
coz the server is handles most of the rendering, we need less resourses on the client 

3- SEO:
coz rendering is done on the server and we send actual content to the client, search engine bots
can view and index our pages.

4- more secure:
coz we can keep sensitive data, like API keys, on the server 

but in the server-side rendering we lose interactivity what that means?
Server Component can`t 
1- listen to browser events
(Click buttons, change, submit, and so....)

2- Access Browser API:
local storage

3- Maintain state.

4- use Effects.

these functionalities are only available in client components.
so in real world application we often use a mixture of server and client components.

we should defualt to the server components and use client components only when absolutely
need them

****************************************************
ex:
we want to build a page to show a list of product to build this page, we need several components
like 
NavBar, SideBar, ProductList, ProductCard, Pagination, Footer

now in the standerd React application we have to package all these components and send them
to the client for rendering.
But in Next.Js we can keep akk the these components on the server and minimize the bundle size
there only one exception 
to add the product to a shopping cart, we need to handle the click event of button 
typically we implement this functionality in the product card component, so we have to make 
it a client component that`s one option 

but is better way we keep all the component into the server and instead we extract a small component
that only handle click the button 
with this change we only ship that tiny component to the client and keep everything else on the server

****************************************************

****************************************************
to see that in action:
in Next.Js all components inside the app folder are server-components by defualt
that`s means all the pages which have craeteed so far, "users" these are server component
by defualt and are rendered on the server 

in Network tab if go to localhost we can see "Hello world" what the engine bots see 
in contrast when create component with react localhost will be empty coz the content is rendering
on the client so the search engine bot can`t see any context

now we inside the app folder we crete components folder and inside it we create ProductCard1.tsx
we create inside it a basic component using "rafce" 
earlier we said server component can`t have interactivity so they can`t handle events(click, change, and so on ...)
that`s means if we add button with onClick event we will have a runtime error 

inside the ProductCard1.tsx we add
<button onClick={() => console.log("Click")}>Add to Cart</button>

then we add that component to the main page in app folder 

we got this error
Unhandled Runtime Error
Error: Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props.
  <button onClick={function} children=...>
                  ^^^^^^^^^^
If you need interactivity, consider converting part of this to a Client Component.

to fix that we have tow options:
1- change the entire ProductCard1.tsx to client component
by adding to the top of component direcive 
"use client"
with this we tell the Next.Js compiler to include this file or this component in our JavaScript bundle
and that`s means if this component is dependent on other components those component will automatically
become client components and will be included in our JavaScript bundle so we don`t have to repeat that
direcive in every client component

better way ProductCard2
2- to make our application faster and more search engine friendly we want to render our components on the 
server as much as possible and use client component only when absolutely necessary

so in ProductCard2 we if have a complex markup we want only to move the button element to client component
so we will extract this separate button and put in different component
now inside the component folder we create AddToCart.tsx
on the top  we use the client direcive then we move the button of ProductCard2.tsx to our AddToCart component
and then we call that AddToCart to our ProductCard2
