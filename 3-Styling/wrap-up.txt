*** 2-Global Styles ***
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)
if the user is on the dark mode 

to clean our global.css file 
************************
from the body we remove
- in the body elements

background: linear-gradient(
      to bottom,
      transparent,
      rgb(var(--background-end-rgb))
    )
    rgb(var(--background-start-rgb));

and instead we add
padding: 1rem;

- @media 
we remove these two lines
--background-start-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
--background-end-rgb: 0, 0, 0;

- root
--background-start-rgb: 214, 219, 220;
--background-end-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
************************

- we copy the app folder from the prevoius lesson (2-Next.js-Fundamentals)
then we run our application in development mode

global.css: to write the styles that apply to all pages, anything related to body/head/footer element

so inside the global.css we should never define a custom classes like user-list cards etc ...
coz as more as our project goes larger global.css we be unmaintainble and more importantlly 
as we change or delete our components, we`ll have to remmber and do some clean-up again in global.css
otherwise we well end up with dead styles in the global.css


*** 3-CSS Modules ***
Css Module:
A Css file that is scoped to a component/page, it`s a way is prevent files form clashes
or overwriting each other.

- if we have the same name of css classes that defined in two different places in two stylesheets
, these classes can overwrite each other depending on how we import thesr stylesheet files
so Css module is aim to solve this problem

how Css Module works:
************************************************************************
in app folder 3-Styling/next-app/app/components
we have multi component
let`s say we want to write a style for 
ProductCard2.tsx

we create to next to it css file but is better to name it the same as the component
and we have to give it .module.css as an extention
ProductCard2.module.css

in the ProductCard2.module.css we can define css classes that related to ProductCard2.tsx component
and now we can write styles in ProductCard2.module.css without worring that is the classes will crash

we define in ProductCard2.module.css
.card {
  padding: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

now we got back to our component and import that sheet  
ProductCard2.tsx
1- import styles from "./ProductCard2.module.css";

the we import it doesn`t matter but typically we go with styles

styles will be JS object and the properties that we define inside the Css file will be
the properties of the styles object

PS:
that`s why we can`t use hyphens in the class name of module.css files coz 
in JS we can`t name property with hyphens ex: .card-color
instead always we should use camel notation ex: .cardColor

2- apply the style to the element we want 
<div className={styles.card}>

now when we look the div tool we can see the name of the class of <div className={styles.card}> in DOM is 
different and auto generated
ex: ProductCard2_card__jGb87

so what is happening here is this project uses a tool called "post CSS" for transforming
our CSS class names to prevent clashes

************************************************************************

in our project we have this file 
postcss.config.js

inside it we have 
plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
for the most part we don`t have to touch this configuration, but if someone advanced post Css user
here where it can provide the custom configuration

so when building our application Next.Js uses post Css to transform our class names and generate
unique class names that don`t clash

if we don`t want to mix our tsx and modle.css file we can create folder and name with the component file and
add our all components file inside it 

PS: we can also Css module to ours page.tsx also 


*** 4-Tailwind Css ***
Tailwind is a famous CSS framework using the concept of utility classes

ex:
some clases for controle of clases 
padding:
p-[number] => padding
px-[number] => horizontal padding
px-[number] => vertical padding
pt-[number] => top padding
pr-[number] => right padding
pb-[number] => bottom padding
pl-[number] => left padding


margin:
m-[number] => margin
mx-[number] => horizontal margin
mx-[number] => vertical margin
mt-[number] => top margin
mr-[number] => right margin
mb-[number] => bottom margin
ml-[number] => left margin


Text:
- Size:
text-xs
text-sm
text-base
text-lg
text-xl
text-2xl
text-3xl
text-4xl

- Color:
text-[color] 
bg-[color] => background color


-Thickness:
font-thin
font-light
font-normal
font-medium
font-bold


if we google Tailwind color palette we can see all the colors
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors

this the idea of Tailwind of course there is ton of classe 

to see it in action:
**********************************
ex:
<div className="p-5 my-5 bg-sky-400 text-white text-xl">Hi</div>

we can also apply hover to it 
<div className="p-5 my-5 bg-sky-400 text-white text-xl hover:bg-sky-600">
**********************************
the idea of Tailwind to style our component inside the tsx file 
instead of jumping between CSS and TSX file 

one benifite to use Tailwind:
when we build our application, our final css bundle will only have the utility
clases that we used in our markup.
so if tomorrow we delete this some element, none of there clases
will be in our final Css bundle, unless we have used them somewhere else
otherwise when using module.css we have to clean unused classes of the component changed
